1 - Booking id issue in getSessionAndUserRecordingsByTimeSlot

Vitero Version below 11: Method getSessionAndUserRecordingsByTimeSlot from vitero returns bookingid value.
This bookingid id, is in fact, a booking time id. They did not change the "bookingid" name to keep back compatibility.
To obtain a booking object from  this booking time id we use the method getBookingByBookingTimeId($bookingTimeId);

Vitero Version 11: Method getSessionAndUserRecordingsByTimeSlot from vitero returns bookingid value.
In this version, the bookingid is a proper booking id, and can be used as expected.

3- Percentage round issue

After doing the maths with the attendance percentage we can obtain decimal values like for example 74.6666%
The current values are stored discriminating the decimals. For this example the stored value is 74%

4- recording_id in the recs table

The recording_id in the recs table is now a session recording id instead of a user recording id, which so far was not
used for anything besides identifying table entries. Be aware of this change to ensure backwards compatibility - on
older installations not every stored recording_id is necessarily a valid session recording id. Further, entries in the
recs table are now uniquely identified by the pair (user_id, recording_id), and not just the recording_id by itself.

5- Updating the Learning Progress whith deleted bookings

Beware that updating the learning progress properly requires the relevant bookings to still be available. Some of the
sessions might not be counted towards the learning progress if the learning progress is not synchronized regularly, or
bookings are deleted right after the session ends.
